                        <p>
                            HiðŸ¦‰ I'm <strong>Rachel Cynthia</strong> Full-stack sorcerer, AI enthusiast, and crochet enthusiast,
                            currently based in the rainy yet lovely city of 
                            <strong> Manchester, UK</strong>.
                            I'm an MSc student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Manchester, with a background as a full-stack developer at
                            <strong> Thoughtworks</strong>, where I built scalable microservices, preached clean code, and deployed
                            cloud-native magic with Java, Spring, Golang, and a healthy dose of caffeine.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By day, I'm diving into machine learning models and cryptographic protocols.
                            I also work part time with the <strong> University Library's Digital Skills Team</strong>,
                            where I get to <em>design content for student workshops, edit videos, plan events, and build web resources</em>
                            that make digital literacy a little more fun and a lot more accessible.
                        </p>

                        <p>When I'm not debugging at 2am or building something weirdly wonderful for a side project (trying to automate unnecessary stuff :P),
                            you'll probably find me:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Volunteering at local parks ðŸŒ± (yes, I plant trees <em>and</em> write algorithms)</li>
                            <li>Crocheting handmade goodies sometimes for charity and sometimes for my <em>(not always)</em> lovely friendsðŸ§¶</li>
                            <li>Writing blogs about circuit breakers and so much more(Trust me they are cooler than they sound) âš¡</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I love blending <strong>tech with storytelling</strong> from designing ML projects that predict the future of food ðŸŒ¾,
                            to helping others grow their digital confidence. I believe in systems that are secure, scalable, and slightly sarcastic (just like me).
                        </p>

                        <p>If you're into clean code, ethical AI, or want to exchange crochet patterns over coffee, let's connect!</p>
